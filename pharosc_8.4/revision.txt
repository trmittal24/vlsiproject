       1. The vsclib and wsclib has been extended to 322 cells with
          the inclusion of a latch function.
       2. The examples directory shows the libraries with looped
          synthesis to find the fastest netlist.
       3. Alliance VBE library files have simulation delay set to load
          capacitance of 25fF.

       1. The vsclib has been extended to 320 cells. Many of the
          existing cells have been redrawn.
       2. Added wsclib, ssxlib, rgalib and vgalib.
       3. Added vtclib, wtclib, stxlib and vtxlib where ALU2 maps
          to metal-1. This allows nero to route metal-1.
       4. The spice function checks use the logic function from
          the pmd file and automatically check that the cell response
          matches the logic function.
       5. First flip-flop added to vsclib and wsclib.
       6. All libraries have been recharacterised.

          using all the libraries. Layout flow for vsc/vtc/wsc/wtc

          no DRC violations.

       1. The vsclib has been extended to 281 cells.
       2. ssxlib, vsxlib libraries made from sxlib and vxlib using
          2um rather than 1um rules.
       3. vtclib, stxlib and vtxlib libraries made which route
          metal one layer higher. That is, metal-2 is routed by
          ALU3 etc. ALU1 is used for internal metal-1 cell connections
          and ALU2 for metal-1 connecting different cells.
       4. vsclib changed so that the vertical routing tracks start
          half a track inside the AB instead of 1 track.
       5. wsclib and wtclib created from vsclib and vtclib. These
          libraries are 80 lambda tall with substrate and well
          contacts shared between cell rows.
       6. More accurate characterisation.

       1. The content of the examples directory has been expanded to
          include the adder4 and multi8 circuits.
       2. Each example has been synthesised with a number of synthesis
          flows, each documented with a flow.txt and README file, and
          the final layout and critical path.
       3. Many detail changes were made to the vsclib and vxlib cells
          in order to improve their routability. This should be of
          benefit to any complex layout using these librarie. 14 vxlib
          and 69 vsclib cells were changed.

       1. The vsclib drawn AB has been adjusted so that it is a
          multiple of 8 lambda wide, rather than the cell width.
       2. The layer used for the drawn AB in the vsclib has changed
          from CALU7 to TALU7, along with the support files in the etc
          directory.
       3. The vsclib contact spacing rule was reduced from 6 to 5
          lambda, and many cells updated with extra contacts as a
          result. The new layout has been recharacterised.
       4. The adder4 example has been moved to the examples directory
          and extensively reworked in all 3 libraries.

       1. The Alliance sxlib has been characterised with the 0.13um
          Berkeley spice parameters. There are now 3 libraries using
          this timing in the release. The sxlib cells which have been
          characterised are combinatorial functions with up to 4
          inputs, a total of 61 cells.
       2. The vsclib characterisation methodology has been revised up
          to be the same as used for the vxlib and sxlib.
       3. The web data book has been enhanced with better graphics,
          and the pages are automatically created with the other files
          during the characterisation. The layout is actual 0.13um
          geometry, rather than nominal 2um lambda rules.
       4. The vxlib cells have been redrawn and many cells added.
          There are now 96 cells in the release.
       5. The vsclib cells have also been redrawn, and the halfadder
          cell added. There are 121 cells in this release.
       6. Horizontal CALU1 has been removed from the Graal cells for
          the vsclib and vxlib. The TALU1 layer now marks the extent
          of ALU1 connected to cell pins.
       7. The 0.13um Alliance RDS and Magic Tech rules files have been
          updated to the latest version of the generic 0.13um rule
          set.
       8. The adder4 example has been completed in all three
          libraries.

       1. Major upgrade, with changes to most of the cells.
       2. The maximum transistor widths in the cells were extended
          from P=27 to P=28 lambda, and N=19 to N=20 lambda.
       3. The routines to write the Alliance CIF cells from the AP 
          cells was improved. The previous one could give short
          circuits.
       4. The abutment box layer (AB) in the Alliance AP cells (layer
          CALU7) is now written out to the CIF and imported into
          magic.
       5. The cifoutput routine from the magic cells was fixed. The
          old one could output connector labels that were not
          attached to any geometry.
       6. The routine to make the N and P-impant layers from magic
          was improved, using the AB layer to define the maximum
          extent.
       7. Two hacks added to the CIF file creation process for the
          vsclib (not yet for the vxlib):
          (a) CIF files written from AP hacked to remove node
          identifers (4N lines) and convert external connectors 
          (4X lines) to 4N lines. The transistor identifiers (which
          use 4N labels) are wrongly visualised in Dreal, and the 4X
          identifiers are not visualised at all.
          (b) CIF files converted from using the magic CIF extensions
          (lines starting with 94) to Alliance CIF extensions (lines
          starting with 4N) now have the AB added back in. The AB
          (line starting with 4A) is not supported in magic and this
          information is lost unless hacked back in.
       8. This release includes full characterisation spice decks for
          the vsclib in a generic 0.13um technology. At this moment,
          these are not available for the vxlib because a different
          conversion is needed to read it into magic, from where the
          cell spice subcircuits are written. The difference is that
          magic uses a transistor channel length of 2 lambda, the same
          as the vsclib, so the conversion is relatively easy. The
          vxlib uses a 1 lambda channel length.
       9. The spice decks used for characterisation are in directory
          magic/spice_vsclib013
          A README file there explains how to use them.
       10.The spice decks and associated scripts produce Alliance VBE
          files with 0.13um timing, and a Synopsys .LIB format file
          with both Prop-Ramp and Table Lookup (LUT) timing
          information.
       11.The schematics for all the vsclib cells have been drawn with
          xcircuit and are in directory 
          xcircuit/cells/vsclib
          One nice feature of xcircuit is that it doesn't use a
          proprietary file format to store the schematic data, but
          instead uses a regular Postscript file with extension .ps.

       1. The Magic cells have been recreated using the vsc200.tech27
          technology file for the cif read in. The original Magic
          cells used generic contacts which caused problems with DRC.
          The new Magic cells have regular poly and diffusion
          contacts. The vsc200.tech27 technology file also checks the
          vsclib DRC rules, though not fully at this time.
       2. From the Magic cells, a set of 0.13um Spice subcircuits has
          been produced which can be simulated in the same way as the
          Alliance ones.
          The Magic Spice subcircuits are more accurate because (a)
          the parasitic diffusion capacitance is calculated correctly
          (Alliance simply sums the transistor source/drain width with
          no adjustment for shared diffusion or contact are); and (b)
          the estimation of the fixed capacitance is more accurate.
       3. 2um and 0.13um CIF files have been written from Magic, and
          can be viewed in DREAL with the vsc200_mosis.rds and
          vsc013_mosis.rds technology files.
       4. On the Alliance side, all the RDS technology files have been
          updated.
          sxlib013.rds, vxlib013.rds, vsc013.rds and vsc013_mosis.rds
          have improved fixed capacitance coefficients correlated to
          the Magic numbers.
          Using this, the Alliance Spice subcircuits for the vsclib
          and vxlib have also been remade.
       5. Finally, the iv1v0x05 and iv1v0x1 from the vsclib and
          aoi21_x05 and aoi21_x1 from the vxlib have been updated to
          fix a metal1 coverage of contact problem (caused by the fact
          that the assymetric contacts are not checked by the DRC).
          This means that there are new versions of the vsclib and
          vxlib in Alliance format, and new vsclib and vxlib CIF files
          written by s2r.
