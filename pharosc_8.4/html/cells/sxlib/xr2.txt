2 XOR gates designed with an AND-OR Invert gate and 2 input inverters. The xr2_x4 then has a large output inverter to drive the output. The xr2_x1 is a 1/2 stage 2-XOR, and the xr2_x4 is a 2/3 stage 2-XOR. Stage efforts are about 2 for the inverter driving the AND-OR-Invert, and 3.5 driving the output inverter.
