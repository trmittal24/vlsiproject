5 cells with different drive strengths, each with a P/N ratio of about 2. The function is made from 2 2-I/P NAND gates as this gives the lowest logical effort. The stage effort for the non-inverting inputs <SPAN CLASS="boldred">a1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="boldred">a2</SPAN> is 1.1 for the aon21bv0x05, 1.4 for the aon21bv0x1, 1.7 for the aon21bv0x2, 2.0 for the aon21bv0x3 and 2.2 for the aon21bv0x4. These stage efforts are optimised for speed with typical wireload values.
