2 styles of mux are shown here. The v0 muxes use two clocked inverters
to drive the output; the v2 muxes use a CMOS transfer gate.<BR>
The v0 style of 2-way mux has the smallest dimensions but is not as
fast as the v2 style. This is because the output CMOS transfer
gate transistors help drive the output both high and low.
