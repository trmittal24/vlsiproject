3 XNOR gates with 2-AND gate input designed for minimum transistor count and hence smallest size. The AND gate is made by changing the inverter on the <SPAN CLASS="boldred">a</SPAN> input of a 2-XNOR gate into a 2-NAND gate. The Prop and Ramp delays below are the average of the inverting and non-inverting delays. The Synopsys Liberty format .LIB file has the correct delays for each case.
