2 cells with different drive strengths, each with a P/N ratio of about 2. The width of the P-transistors connected to pins <SPAN CLASS="boldred">b</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="boldred">c</SPAN> are designed to have a similar conductivity to the two series P-transistors, so that there is a consistent output drive capability.
