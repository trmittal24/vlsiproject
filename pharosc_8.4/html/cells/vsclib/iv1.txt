<P>Inverters with different drive strengths and P/N ratios.<BR>
The P/N ratios used for each version are shown to the right.
The P:N ratio of 2 offers good output skew and speed,
while 1.5 is close to the fastest speed. 2.25 is a balanced ratio if
the mobility ratio &micro; equals 2.25 and 2.6 is balanced for this
techno where &micro; is close to 2.6. P/N ratios of 1 and 4 give
heavily skewed outputs for specific applications.<BR>
The v6, v7 and v8 versions are experimental cells.
The iv1v2x2 is considered as the reference inverter for
logical effort calculations.
