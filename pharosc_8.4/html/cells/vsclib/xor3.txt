The v0 version is a 1 or 2 stage gate. The v1 versions are 2 to 4 stage gates from the <SPAN CLASS="boldred">a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="boldred">b</SPAN> inputs; 1 or 2 stages from the <SPAN CLASS="boldred">c</SPAN> input. Although the v1 versions have more stages, their performance is better. The v0 version is included only as a comparison, since the large internal parasitic capacitances and 3 P-transistors in series make the gate slow. The xor3v1x05 is made from 2 xor2v0x05 cells; the xor3v1x1 from 2 xor2v0x1 cells; the xor3v1x2 from an xor2v0x1 and xor2v0x2.
