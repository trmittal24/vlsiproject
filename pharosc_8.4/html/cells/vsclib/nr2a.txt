Single stage 2-I/P NOR gates with one inverted input.
6 drive strengths with a P/N ratio of 1 for the <B>nr2v1x05</B>
and 2 for the bigger drive strengths and the input inverter.
The stage efforts for the non-inverting input are
1.3, 1.6, 2.1, 2.3, 2.6, and 2.9 for the
<B>x05</B>, <B>x1</B>, <B>x2</B>, <B>x3</B>, <B>x4</B>
and <B>x6</B> cells respectively.
