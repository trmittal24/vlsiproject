The fastest speed occurs when the shape factor
<SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">r</SPAN>=&radic;(
<SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">K<SUB>P</SUB></SPAN>&divide;
<SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">K<SUB>N</SUB></SPAN>&times;&micro;).
For a 2-NOR gate, we use <SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">K<SUB>P</SUB></SPAN>=15/8;
<SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">K<SUB>N</SUB></SPAN>=1, and &micro;=9/4,
which gives <SPAN CLASS="mathsvar">r</SPAN>=&radic;(135/32)&asymp;2.
This value has been used for the <B>v1</B> version,
which are fast with unbalanced output skews.
The P/N ratio has been kept as close to 2 as possible for the <B>v0</B> version
in order to give more balanced output skews,
even if this is not the fastest configuration.<BR>
The effort measured by the fanout=4 method is shown in the graph on the right,
which shows that the <B>v1</B> cells are generally faster than the <B>v0</B>
cells.
The variations are caused by the parasitic capacitances.
