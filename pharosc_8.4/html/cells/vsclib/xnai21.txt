Minimum size 2-XNOR gates followed by a 2-NAND,
implemented as a single gate with a single stage
inverting delay and a 2-stage non-inverting delay.
The NAND gate is made by adding a series
N-transistor in the pull down path and a parallel
P-transistor to the pull up path.
The Prop and Ramp delays below are the average of the
inverting and non-inverting delays. The Synopsys Liberty
format .LIB file has the correct delays for each case.
