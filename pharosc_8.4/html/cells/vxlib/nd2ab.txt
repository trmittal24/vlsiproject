The nd2ab gates are 2-OR gates made up as 2 inverters driving a NAND gate. According to the theory of logical effort, this combination should be faster than a regular or2 gate, and it is. The speed can be compared to the <A HREF="or2.html">or2 gates</A>, especially the or2v0x1 which has the same output P-transistor size as the nd2abv0x1. The nd2ab gates are bigger and consume more power than the or2 gates.
