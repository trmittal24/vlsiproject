The directories with names ending in 100 and 200 contain
.bash scripts which are run to produce the initial VBE
files. These are the files in ../vbe/---100 or 200.
The sxlib timing comes from Alliance. The other libraries
don't have meaningful timing.

The directories with names ending in 013 have .bash
scripts produced by the characterisation (in directory
magic/spice_vsclib013/an2 for the vsclib 1-AND gates
for example). The characterisation script executes the
.bash files and writes the VBE files to the vbe directory.
